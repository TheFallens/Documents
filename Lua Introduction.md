# üìù Introducing Luau 
This repost is where you can learn many diffrent codes about lua
for example 
```luau
print("Hello World");
```

## About the code `GetGenv():`
```luau
function getgenv(): { [string]: any }
```
It stands for "Get Global Environment". It returns a table representing the executor‚Äôs custom global environment. This allows you to create and access global variables, functions, and tables that persist across different scripts.

You can directly access global variables and functions stored in getgenv() without needing to use `getgenv().variableName`. For example, if a variable is stored as `getgenv().myVariable`, you can access it directly by just using `myVariable`.
However, if a local variable with the same name exists, the local variable will take precedence. In such cases, you must use `getgenv().variableName` to access the global variable.
